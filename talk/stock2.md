abstract = "In this workshop, undergraduate and graduate students will learn the basics of two software: ELAN – for transcribing and organizing linguistic corpora – and R – for compiling, manipulating and performing statistical analyses on linguistic data. Students will be encouraged to practice their use in hands-on sessions and to discuss their application on their own data. At the end of the workshop students will be able to: (i) Transcribe audio and video files in ELAN; (ii) Perform automatic searches in ELAN; (iii) Write and use simple scripts in R; (iv) Perform basic descriptive and inferential statistical analyses in R. As an introductory course, the main objective is to offer an overview of how these tools can greatly facilitate and enhance linguistic analyses. Several references for further study will also be provided."
